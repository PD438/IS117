Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! 
As one or our members told us:
Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.


<h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>

Season Package: $95
Patron Package: $200
Single Speaker: $25
